############################ Code and Data #############################

The code and data are available as separate tarballs: 
* http://people.csail.mit.edu/rgrosse/intrinsic/intrinsic-code-python.tar.gz
* http://people.csail.mit.edu/rgrosse/intrinsic/intrinsic-data.tar.gz

Unpack the tarballs and merge if necessary. The top-level folder, named
MIT-intrinsic by default, should contain the README, four python
files, the data folder, and two empty results folders.

The four python files are:
* comparison.py: the script for performing hold-one-out cross-validation.
* intrinsic.py: all of the intrinsic image algorithms, along with functions
        for reading the data and computing the error scores
* poisson.py: functions for solving the Poisson equation using least-squares or L1.
* html.py: a utility for saving results to HTML.

After installing the required packages (see below), you should be able to
reproduce most of the results from the paper by running comparison.py:

   cd MIT-intrinsic
   python comparison.py

This will evaluate the algorithms using hold-one-out cross-validation. It prints
results to the console, and also saves the shading/reflectance decompositions and
their error scores to the HTML file results/index.html. If you set the USE_L1
variable (defined in comparison.py) to True, it will use the L1 penalty for reconstruction
rather than least squares. In this case, the outputs will be saved to results_L1/index.html.

We have done our best to provide a code base which is readable, compact, and easy to
extend.

Please send your questions and comments to Roger Grosse (rgrosse@mit.edu).
